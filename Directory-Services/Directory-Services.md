Aws Directory Services

1) AWS Managed Microsoft AD

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition) is an actual Microsoft Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. You can use it to support Active Directory–aware workloads; Amazon Relational Database Service for Microsoft SQL Server; AWS managed services such as Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon QuickSight; or Linux applications that require an LDAP directory. Your end users benefit from a Windows integrated single sign-on experience whether you use it as a stand-alone directory in the AWS Cloud, or you extend your existing Active Directory infrastructure into the AWS cloud using an Active Directory trust.

it is created as a highly available pair of domain controllers connected to your virtual private cloud (Amazon VPC). The domain controllers run in different Availability Zones in a Region of your choice. Host monitoring and recovery, data replication, snapshots, and software updates are automatically configured and managed for you.

With AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can run directory-aware workloads in the AWS Cloud, including Microsoft SharePoint and custom .NET and SQL Server-based applications. You can also configure a trust relationship between AWS Managed Microsoft AD in the AWS Cloud and your existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory, providing users and groups with access to resources in either domain, using AWS IAM Identity Center.

2) Simple AD

Simple AD is a low-scale, low-cost directory with basic Active Directory compatibility. You can use it as a stand-alone directory in the AWS Cloud to support AWS applications and services, support Samba 4–compatible applications, and to support Linux applications that need an LDAP directory.

3) AD Connector

AD Connector is a proxy that enables you to use identities from your existing self-managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with compatible AWS applications. You can also use AD Connector to join Amazon EC2 instances to your AD domain and manage these instances using your existing group policy objects. This makes it easier to deploy AD-aware applications on these Amazon EC2 instances and use your self-managed AD for your organisation.
